Players choose from a list of options that determine the character's actions.
text-based artwork helps add more immersion to the experience. 

Features include:

A master loop - see Menu.cs for details.
The title menu and the game menu both allow players to enter commands.

Create a list - See line 44 of Game.cs.

Visual representation of data - See Game.cs for details. Health bars visually 
allow users to easily track player and enemy health.

Calculate and display data based on external factors - see Game.cs for details.
Both player health and enemy health are re-calculated based on player choices.
These values are then displayed each turn that either ATTACK or ITEM is selected.
